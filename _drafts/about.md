*An outline of unwritten posts*

Portland was a great place to start.

At PayPal, I built something that made other people's lives better.

In silence, I separated solitude from loneliness.

At Google, I ate my feelings.

In a startup with friends, I learned the importance of purpose.

On the parched desert floor, my purpose became clear.

On a sojourn in India, I sought the company of seekers.

At Hack Reactor, I was surprised by what I found.

Through [Siliconfidential](http://www.siliconfidential.com), I share.
