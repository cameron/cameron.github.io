Portland was not a bad place to start.

At PayPal, I built something that made other people's lives better.

In silence, I separated solitude from loneliness.

At Google, I ate my feelings.

On the parched desert floor, my purpose became clear.

On a sojourn in India, I sought the company of seekers.

At Hack Reactor, my motivations came out of hiding.

Through [Siliconfidential](http://www.siliconfidential.com), I share.
