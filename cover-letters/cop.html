<h1>How About Some Homegrown Software?</h1>


<p>I&rsquo;ve been developing and maintaining complex web applications for more than twenty years, since I taught myself to code here in Portland while attending Grant High School. Even before graduating, I completed several paid contracts developing database-driven web apps using PHP, MySQL, ActionScript (Flash), JavaScript, and, of course, HTML/CSS, often contributing UX and UI design to the projects.</p>

<p>I continued doing contract web development while studying Computer Engineering at Santa Clara University, interning at PayPal, and then joining a social games startup in San Francisco where I wrote mostly Python and JavaScript. That company was acquired by Google, where I built a friend recommender service for Google+, the failed social network, worked on an iOS photo sharing application, and wrote more Python and JavaScript while maintaining YouTube&rsquo;s playlist management page.</p>

<p>In the years since, I&rsquo;ve worked across the spectrum of company size, from two-person startups doing full-stack application development, to Series-A funded startups doing database scaling work. I&rsquo;ve even built internal tools for Facebook&rsquo;s design teams. No matter the size of the company, I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed projects where I can contribute to UX and UI design — understanding the user&rsquo;s needs and building a delightful interface to meet them is deeply satisfying, and I have an unusually broad skillset that includes Linux server management, shell scripting, Docker, cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud, SQL, NoSQL, and graph databases, several server-side scripting languages (Python, JavaScript, Ruby), as well as several client-side platforms (iOS, web, and Android).</p>

<p>And as the son of an English teacher and journalist, documenting my work has always come easily.</p>

<p>Working for the City of Portland would add a new dimension of satisfaction—that of being in service to the city that I was raised in, that I’m proud to call home again. I would be delighted to discuss solving problems for the City&rsquo;s Water Bureau team!</p>

<p>P.S. To my understanding, I&rsquo;ve addressed all of the minimum requirements, but wanted to clarify that I don&rsquo;t have direct experience with Apache Tomcat, though I&rsquo;m familiar with it. I&rsquo;ve used nginx and other web servers, often containerizing them using Docker to orchestrate deployment and reproducible enviroments. I hope that suffices! </p>
