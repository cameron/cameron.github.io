    <h1>A Good Fit to Fight Crime?</h1>

    <p>Reading this job description took me back to pre-adolescent mornings when I would wake to the clear, confident tones of BBC reporters as rebroadcast by National Public Radio here in America. I lay half-dreaming the news of a world far beyond my own, often scandal or disaster or as much impending, couched in complex political realities and spoken with that distinct air of objectivity and moral consequence.</p>

    <p>My father was a journalist early in his career, and while he instilled in me a value of political awareness, I found myself disillusioned by what I learned as a teenager about the influence of corporations in American politics via campaign financing, revolving-door regulatory bodies, and woefully centralized media outlets. Despite hewing from politics and media in my career, I&rsquo;ve always valued independent journalism and its ability to show us where our social reality falls short of our political values.</p>

    <p>That tack perhaps has finally brought me to a point of working in service to the Fourth Estate.</p>

    <p>Over the last 20+ years, I&rsquo;ve developed an unusually broad skillset in software product development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At Google, I wrangled an 8TB dataset of user interaction data from Facebook games to build the friend-recommender service for Google+.</li>
      <li>At IRL, I maintained a ~5 million DAU MySQL instance and coordinated across teams to develop a plan for 10x growth.</li>
      <li>At Aura, I increased development velocity by writing tests for the LLM and prompts used to power a family documentarian app.</li>
      <li>At university, I used tf-idf vectorization and cosine similarity to build a note-taking app that allowed students to discover notes similar to their own.</li>
      <li>At ReSim, I course-corrected the product by recognizing parallels between the workflow of their customers, robotics developers, and consumer web software engineers.</li>
      <li>At Aikito, I managed developers across a 13-hour timezone span, hired and mentored an intern, and ran weekly product meetings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve also completed two machine learning courses (Google&rsquo;s online course and Deep Atlas&rsquo; in-person), worked regularly with infrastructure in AWS, and built tools for the design teams of WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.</p>

<p>My favorite roles have always been those that require me to work beyond engineering, aiming at organizational outcomes with good user experience design and the right technical tradeoffs. It would be a delight and an honor to discuss bringing my skills to the OCCRP.</p>
